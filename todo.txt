- implement ffmpegcpp wrapper
V	- list devices/muxers
V	- list codecs
V	- list cameras
		- open camera, select resolution/fps
V	- list audio devices
		- open audio device, select sample rate and channel configuration
	- grab mat configuration for camera
	- grab mat configuraiton for audio
		- grab an image into mat
		- grab an audio sample into mat
	- open output
		- encode image
		- encode audio
		- mux image/audio
	- close and reopen
		
- implement opencv
	- mat
	- camera calibration
	- 
- implement openbr
	- face recognition
	- age estimation
	- gender estimation
- implement tesseract
	- recognize text, any language
- implement OMR library - ZXing 

-implement uv_queue_work instead of uv_async_send for logger
	- implement log pulling/clearing functions so the messages will be more localized to calling functions
		- might cause problems in multi context environments, but great for debugging


- tests
	- test camera
	- test audio
	- test encoding
	- test decoding
	- test rtp


Low Priority:
- Fix debug build, it seems that LTCG is preventing the build from completing, it could also 
	be a Debug only option that makes the linker verify all the references and prevents it from compiling properly.
